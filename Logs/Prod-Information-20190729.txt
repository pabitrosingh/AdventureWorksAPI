2019-07-29T16:29:58.3080757+05:30 0HLOK2FIAC7LR:00000001 [WRN] The property '"ShiftId"' on entity type '"Shift"' is of type 'byte', but is set up to use a SQL Server identity column. This requires that values starting at 255 and counting down will be used for temporary key values. A temporary key value is needed for every entity inserted in a single call to 'SaveChanges'. Care must be taken that these values do not collide with real key values. (316a401d)
